Exploit the temporal information of the dataset preparing it for a univariate framework of analysis,
i.e. select a feature and use it as your time series. You are welcome in using more than one reliable temporal
split to have more time series of the same feature. You are welcome in creating more than a dataset using more than
a feature and report the result on the feature you prefer or more than one.

Apply forecasting methods on the dataset(s) created. Make sure to preprocess adequately the time series
according to the method used (e.g., an exponential smoothing or an autoregression),
indeed checking stationarity and reducing trends and seasonality or with the help of a statistically significant test;

Solve the classification task considering the whole dataset as a multivariate dataset.
Develop the classification process you prefer (CNN, or RNN)
to maximize accuracy and F1-score.
