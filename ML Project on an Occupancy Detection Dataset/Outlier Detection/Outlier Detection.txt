From the original dataset (i.e. not the time series built on Task 3 or sequences of Task 4, nor the preprocessed dataset used in Tasks 1 and 2),
identify the top 1% outliers.
Adopt at least three different methods belonging to different families
(i.e. statistical/depth-based, distance-based, density-based, angle-based, …) and compare the results.

(Optional) Try to use an explanation method to illustrate the reasons for the classification in one of the steps of the previous Tasks
(if you want to try LORE please ask the code to riccardo.guidotti@unipi.it).
